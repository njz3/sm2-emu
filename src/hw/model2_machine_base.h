// The board-agnostic call surface every Model 2 machine variant presents to
// main.cpp, the debug dump functions (hw/model2_debug.cpp) and the renderer
// (render/vk/poly3d_pass.cpp).
//
// This interface is deliberately narrower than any one board's own class: it
// covers exactly what those three consumers call on a machine instance today,
// which is init/reset/run_frame, the input latch, the produced render list,
// NVRAM persistence, and the handful of video and diagnostic accessors the
// debug dumps and the 3D pass read. It does not cover the geometry coprocessor,
// the sound board or the sound link (Model2::copro()/sound()/uart()): those
// return board-specific hardware types (CoproTgp, Model2Sound, I8251) that do
// not generalise across boards -- Model 2B's coprocessor is a SHARC wrapped in
// a CoproSharc, Model 2C's is an MB86235 wrapped in a CoproTgpx4, and the
// original Model 2's sound board is YM3438 + MultiPCM, not 68000/SCSP. Code
// that needs those stays against the concrete board class.
//
// -- CPU state reporting across differing core types ------------------------
//
// main.cpp's boot-test report reads the main CPU's state through
// Model2::cpu(): faulted(), fault_message(), state_string(), halted() and
// instructions(). Every board this project will add runs a different core
// there (i960 on Model 2 and 2A, SHARC on Model 2B, MB86235 on Model 2C), so
// this interface needs some way to ask for that without knowing which.
//
// Two shapes were considered:
//
//   1. A type-erased CpuStatus snapshot struct (below), built by each board's
//      main_cpu_status() from whichever concrete core it owns.
//   2. A virtual base class every CPU core implements, so the interface could
//      just return a reference to it.
//
// (1) was chosen. cpu::i960::I960 and cpu::mb86233::MB86233 -- and every core
// this project ports the same way in later waves (SHARC, MB86235) -- are kept
// textually close to their MAME originals on purpose, so that upstream fixes
// stay diffable (see sm2_warnings_ported's rationale in src/CMakeLists.txt).
// Retrofitting a virtual interface onto them would touch code whose entire
// value is reading like upstream, for a feature (polymorphic status reporting)
// that only the boot-test's summary print actually needs. A type-erased struct
// costs one small allocation-bearing copy per report, which happens at most
// once a frame, and touches none of the ported cores.
