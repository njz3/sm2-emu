// Model 2 sound board: a 68000 with 512 KB of RAM and an SCSP.
//
// The memory map follows MAME's model2_snd in src/mame/sega/model2.cpp
// (BSD-3-Clause) region for region.
//
// The board is almost independent of the CPU board. It has its own ROM, its own
// RAM and its own clock; the only link is a serial one, an i8251 on the host side
// talking to the SCSP's MIDI port, which carries the sound commands. There is no
// reset line from the host either, so the sound program runs from power-on and
// this can be brought up and verified without the host being involved at all.
