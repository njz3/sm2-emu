// Per-device light guns, one host device per player.
//
// SDL merges every physical mouse into one system pointer, so it cannot tell
// two light guns apart. This class reads each gun as its own device and sits
// beside the SDL input path, which still handles the keyboard, the pads and
// the single-mouse fallback.
//
// There are two backends. On Linux (evdev_gun.cpp) guns are evdev nodes found
// through libudev, by the ID_INPUT_GUN property or a light-gun model name. On
// Windows (rawinput_gun.cpp) guns are Raw Input mice with a light-gun product
// name. Both report buttons as Linux evdev key codes, so the bindings in the
// config work on either platform.
//
// The evdev technique follows Supermodel's evdev input system, but no code is
// taken from it: Supermodel is GPL-3.0 and this tree is BSD-3-Clause.
